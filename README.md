# Timeframe
Create your own Timeframe.

I do not like static art, I do not like pictures and I do not like paintings.
Why? because in my eyes they are dead, because life is something that happens accross time and static art presents a dead moment.

So, I decided that I'll hang a living moment in my living room, and what better art can I possibly find than my own life?
I call it "Timeframe".
